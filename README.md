# FSMgine

A modern C++ library for building robust finite state machines with a fluent builder interface, thread-safety support, and memory-efficient string interning. This library was written with much support from several AI.

## Features

- **Fluent Builder API**: Type-safe, self-documenting interface for FSM construction
- **Thread Safety**: Optional multi-threaded support via separate library variant
- **Memory Efficient**: String interning reduces memory footprint and improves performance
- **RAII Design**: Move-only semantics and clear ownership models
- **Flexible Architecture**: No event loop management - integrates into existing applications
- **Dual Library Variants**: Separate single-threaded and multi-threaded libraries for optimal performance and clear usage

## Library Architecture

FSMgine provides two library variants to ensure clear thread-safety semantics:

- **`libFSMgine`**: Single-threaded variant with no synchronization overhead
- **`libFSMgineMT`**: Multi-threaded variant with full thread-safety using mutexes

Both libraries share the same API but have different runtime characteristics:
- The single-threaded variant (`FSMgine`) has no locking overhead and doesn't require pthread
- The multi-threaded variant (`FSMgineMT`) provides thread-safe operations at the cost of synchronization overhead

The libraries include:
- `StringInterner` singleton implementation for memory-efficient state name storage
- Core FSM functionality
- Thread synchronization primitives (in the MT variant only)

**Important:** You must link against the appropriate FSMgine library variant based on your threading requirements.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HarryPehkonen/FSMgine.git
cd FSMgine

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure with CMake (builds both library variants by default)
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local

# Or configure to build only specific variants:
# Single-threaded only:
cmake .. -DFSMGINE_BUILD_SINGLETHREADED=ON -DFSMGINE_BUILD_MULTITHREADED=OFF

# Multi-threaded only:
cmake .. -DFSMGINE_BUILD_SINGLETHREADED=OFF -DFSMGINE_BUILD_MULTITHREADED=ON

# Build and install
make
sudo make install
```

After installation, you'll have:
- `/usr/local/lib/libFSMgine.{a,so}` - Single-threaded library
- `/usr/local/lib/libFSMgineMT.{a,so}` - Multi-threaded library
- `/usr/local/include/FSMgine/` - Shared headers
- `/usr/local/lib/cmake/FSMgine/` - CMake config for single-threaded
- `/usr/local/lib/cmake/FSMgineMT/` - CMake config for multi-threaded

## Quick Start

The simplest way to use FSMgine is with an event-less FSM, where state transitions are controlled by external variables.

```cpp
#include "FSMgine/FSMgine.hpp"
#include <iostream>

using namespace fsmgine;

// Create an event-less FSM
FSM turnstile;
bool coin_inserted = false;
bool door_pushed = false;

// Build with fluent interface
turnstile.get_builder()
    .onEnter("LOCKED", [](const std::monostate& event) { std::cout << "ðŸ”’ Locked\n"; })
    .onEnter("UNLOCKED", [](const std::monostate& event) { std::cout << "ðŸ”“ Unlocked\n"; })
    .from("LOCKED")
    .predicate([&](const std::monostate& event) { return coin_inserted; })
    .action([&](const std::monostate& event) { coin_inserted = false; })
    .to("UNLOCKED");

turnstile.get_builder()
    .from("UNLOCKED")
    .predicate([&](const std::monostate& event) { return door_pushed; })
    .action([&](const std::monostate& event) { door_pushed = false; })
    .to("LOCKED");

// Run the FSM
turnstile.setInitialState("LOCKED");

// Simulate external events changing the state
coin_inserted = true;
turnstile.process(); // Transitions to UNLOCKED

door_pushed = true;
turnstile.process(); // Transitions back to LOCKED
```

## Quick Start (Event-Driven)

For a more robust and scalable design, you can define specific events to drive the FSM. This avoids managing external state variables and is the recommended approach for most applications.

```cpp
#include "FSMgine/FSMgine.hpp"
#include <iostream>

using namespace fsmgine;

// 1. Define events that can drive the FSM
enum class TurnstileEvent { COIN_INSERTED, DOOR_PUSHED };

int main() {
    // 2. Create an FSM that handles these events
    FSM<TurnstileEvent> turnstile;

    // 3. Build the FSM using predicates that check the event
    turnstile.get_builder()
        .onEnter("LOCKED", [](const TurnstileEvent& triggeringEvent){ std::cout << "ðŸ”’ Locked\n"; })
        .onEnter("UNLOCKED", [](const TurnstileEvent& triggeringEvent){ std::cout << "ðŸ”“ Unlocked\n"; });

    turnstile.get_builder()
        .from("LOCKED")
        .predicate([](const TurnstileEvent& e) { return e == TurnstileEvent::COIN_INSERTED; })
        .to("UNLOCKED");

    turnstile.get_builder()
        .from("UNLOCKED")
        .predicate([](const TurnstileEvent& e) { return e == TurnstileEvent::DOOR_PUSHED; })
        .to("LOCKED");

    // 4. Run the FSM by processing events
    turnstile.setInitialState("LOCKED");
    turnstile.process(TurnstileEvent::COIN_INSERTED); // Transitions to UNLOCKED
    turnstile.process(TurnstileEvent::DOOR_PUSHED);   // Transitions back to LOCKED
}
```

## Usage Patterns

### Encapsulating the FSM in a Class

For larger applications, it's best practice to encapsulate the FSM and its related state within a class. This provides a clean public API and hides implementation details.

```cpp
class Turnstile {
public:
    Turnstile() {
        // Lambdas can capture `this` to access member variables
        fsm_.get_builder()
            .from("LOCKED")
            .predicate([this](const std::monostate& event) { return coin_inserted_; })
            .action([this](const std::monostate& event) { coin_inserted_ = false; })
            .to("UNLOCKED");

        fsm_.get_builder()
            .from("UNLOCKED")
            .predicate([this](const std::monostate& event) { return door_pushed_; })
            .action([this](const std::monostate& event) { door_pushed_ = false; })
            .to("LOCKED");

        fsm_.setInitialState("LOCKED");
    }

    // Public methods control the FSM's inputs
    void insertCoin() { coin_inserted_ = true; }
    void pushDoor() { door_pushed_ = true; }

    // The main loop calls process() to run the logic
    void update() { fsm_.process(); }

private:
    FSM<> fsm_;
    bool coin_inserted_ = false;
    bool door_pushed_ = false;
};
```

### Transitions Without Predicates

If a transition should always occur (no condition), you can omit the predicate:

```cpp
fsm.get_builder()
    .from("STATE_A")
    .action([](const EventType& e) { /* always execute this */ })
    .to("STATE_B");
```

## State Management

FSMgine provides two methods for setting the current state:

- **`setInitialState(state)`**: Use this for first-time FSM initialization. It sets the current state and executes any `onEnter` actions for that state. This should be called once after building your FSM to establish the starting state.

- **`setCurrentState(state)`**: Use this for runtime state changes when you need to forcibly change the state outside of normal transitions. It executes `onExit` actions for the current state (if any) and `onEnter` actions for the new state. This is useful for reset functionality or error recovery scenarios.

## Example Use Cases

These examples demonstrate how to apply FSMgine to solve common problems. They illustrate patterns for managing state and logic within the FSM's actions and predicates.

### 1. Resource Pool Management
Demonstrates a thread-safe resource pool.
- **Pattern:** The FSM models the state of the pool (`IDLE`, `BUSY`, `EMPTY`). FSM actions modify an `std::atomic<int>` counter for available resources. This example should be linked against `FSMgineMT` to ensure thread-safe FSM operations in combination with atomic variables for concurrent access safety.

### 2. Protocol Parser
Shows how to build a state machine for parsing a simple network protocol string.
- **Pattern:** The FSM transitions character by character through states like `WAITING_HEADER`, `READING_PAYLOAD`, and `VALIDATING`. Actions append characters to buffer strings (`current_command`, `current_param`). This pattern is ideal for stream processing and validation tasks.

### 3. Calculator Implementation
Implements a calculator using two FSMs: one for tokenizing the input string and another for parsing and evaluating the expression.
- **Pattern:** Shows a more advanced, two-stage FSM design. The tokenizer FSM produces a stream of `Token` objects, which are then fed as events into the parser FSM. Actions in the parser manipulate stacks for values and operators, demonstrating how to maintain complex context between states.

### 4. Parentheses Checker
A simple but effective example that validates balanced parentheses in a string.
- **Pattern:** An FSM processes the input character by character. An `onEnter` action pushes opening parentheses onto a `std::stack`, while other transitions pop and validate closing parentheses. This is a minimal but complete example of using an FSM for validation logic.

## Integration

### CMake Integration

FSMgine provides two library variants that can be used based on your threading requirements:

#### Single-Threaded Usage

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
project(your_project)

find_package(FSMgine REQUIRED)

add_executable(your_project src/main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(your_project PRIVATE FSMgine::FSMgine)
```

#### Multi-Threaded Usage

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
project(your_project)

find_package(FSMgineMT REQUIRED)

add_executable(your_project src/main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(your_project PRIVATE FSMgine::FSMgineMT)
```

**Note:** The CMake targets automatically handle:
- Linking against the appropriate static library
- Including necessary headers
- Linking against `Threads::Threads` (for FSMgineMT only)
- Setting the `FSMGINE_MULTI_THREADED` compile definition (for FSMgineMT only)

## Troubleshooting

### Undefined references to `StringInterner`

If you see linker errors like:
```
undefined reference to `fsmgine::StringInterner::instance()'
undefined reference to `fsmgine::StringInterner::intern(...)'
```

This means you're not linking against the FSMgine library. Ensure:
1. You've called `find_package(FSMgine REQUIRED)` or `find_package(FSMgineMT REQUIRED)` in your CMakeLists.txt
2. You've added the appropriate target to your link libraries:
   - `FSMgine::FSMgine` for single-threaded
   - `FSMgine::FSMgineMT` for multi-threaded
3. The appropriate library is properly installed (`sudo make install` was successful)

Example fix:
```cmake
# For single-threaded:
find_package(FSMgine REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE FSMgine::FSMgine)

# For multi-threaded:
find_package(FSMgineMT REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE FSMgine::FSMgineMT)
```

### Thread-related linking errors

If you're using FSMgineMT but getting pthread-related errors:
- The FSMgineMT CMake configuration should automatically handle pthread linking
- If issues persist, ensure your system has pthread development headers installed

### Mixing library variants

**Important:** Do not link both FSMgine and FSMgineMT in the same executable. Choose one based on your threading requirements:
- Use `FSMgine` for single-threaded applications (no synchronization overhead)
- Use `FSMgineMT` for multi-threaded applications (thread-safe operations)

### FSMgine package not found

If CMake cannot find FSMgine or FSMgineMT:
1. Ensure the libraries are installed: `sudo make install` from the FSMgine build directory
2. Check that you built the variant you're trying to use
3. Check installation prefix matches your system's CMake search paths
4. Alternatively, specify the path manually:
   ```cmake
   find_package(FSMgine REQUIRED PATHS /path/to/fsmgine/install)
   # or
   find_package(FSMgineMT REQUIRED PATHS /path/to/fsmgine/install)
   ```

## Requirements

- C++17 or later
- CMake 3.20+
- Google Test (optional, for testing)
- Threads library (required only for FSMgineMT variant)
